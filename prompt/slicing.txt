Python Library Migration Task
    You will be tasked with reimplementing a Python code snippet, migrating it from `{libo}` to `{libn}`.

ðŸ“Œ Code Migration Instructions:
- Replace each line of the original API usage with the selected API from the new library, line by line.
- Do not omit any migration lines, even if some lines are deleted during the rewrite.
- Ensure the final code is syntactically correct and free of errors.
- When using APIs, make sure to call them in the correct context.
- Consider the return values of the APIs.

ðŸ“Œ Migration Insight
- In most cases, the **input arguments do not change** between the original and target APIs.
- The migration should focus only on **replacing the API call**, not refactoring or transforming the logic, arguments, or output.
- You must **preserve all input arguments, their names, order, and types**, unless the new API strictly requires a change.
- Do not add, remove, reformat, or reinterpret arguments unless it is essential for compatibility with the new API.

Important Notes:
- Use any supported arguments from the selected API that help preserve the original behavior.

Your response must include only the **full migrated code**.
No explanations, comments, or additional text.

Example input code when migrating from `oldlib` to `newlib`, and the API to be replaced is `compute`:
>>> Example Input
# original
```python
result = oldlib.compute(data, normalize=True)
```

Example output when migrating from `oldlib` to `newlib`, and the API to be replaced is `compute`:

>>> Example Output
```python
import newlib
def A():
    data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = newlib.calculate(data, normalize=True)
```
