Versioning
==========

Quart uses `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ with the
caveat that Quart has yet to reach it's first major release. This
means there may be changes between minor versions that would be
considered major version changes - these are avoided and indicated in
the changelog.

Long term support
-----------------

Only the latest release is supported and hence likely to receive
updates. No previous releases are supported. Please always upgrade to
the latest Quart release where possible.

Python versions
---------------

Quart will support Python versions until they reach end of life. This
may, is rare circumstances be achieved by bug fixes to a specific
release branch i.e. no new features. This happended with Python 3.6
and the Quart 0.5.X releases.
