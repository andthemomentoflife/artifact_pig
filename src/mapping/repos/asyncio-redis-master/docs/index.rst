asyncio_redis
=============

Asynchronous Redis client for Python.

.. _PEP 3156: http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3156/
.. _GitHub: https://github.com/jonathanslenders/asyncio-redis

This Redis library is a completely asynchronous, non-blocking client for a Redis server.
It depends on asyncio (PEP 3156) and requires Python 3.6 or greater. If you're new to
asyncio, it can be helpful to check out `the asyncio documentation`_ first.
